### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently learning data science and python at General Assembly. It reminds me of those old days when I studied computing science 20 years ago. Becoming a data scienist is my goal, as I feel that it is fun and joyful to solve business problems from the perspectives of Data Science.

Working as an operations manager fully in charge of two projects, I need to make many difficult business decisions in order to deliver the best service to our clients in time, within budget, fully complying with regulations as well as taking care of worker wellbeing. I believe that the work philosophy which I developed in this position also apply in data science.
